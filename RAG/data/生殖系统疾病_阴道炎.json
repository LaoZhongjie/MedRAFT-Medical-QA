    "information": "To diagnose vaginitis, your health care provider is likely to: Review your medical history. This includes your history of vaginal or sexually transmitted infections. Perform a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam, your provider may use an instrument (speculum) to look inside your vagina for inflammation and discharge. Collect a sample for lab testing. Your provider might collect a sample of cervical or vaginal discharge for lab testing to confirm what kind of vaginitis you have. Perform pH testing. Your provider might test your vaginal pH by applying a pH test stick or pH paper to the wall of your vagina. An elevated pH can indicate either bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. But pH testing alone is not a reliable diagnostic test. A variety of organisms and conditions can cause vaginitis, so treatment targets the specific cause: Bacterial vaginosis. For this type of vaginitis, your provider might prescribe metronidazole tablets (Flagyl) you swallow, metronidazole gel (MetroGel) that you apply to your vagina, or clindamycin cream (Cleocin) that you apply to your vagina. Other treatments include clindamycin tablets you swallow, clindamycin ovules that you insert into your vagina, or tinidazole (Tindamax) or secnidazole (Solosec) tablets you swallow. Bacterial vaginosis can recur after treatment. Yeast infections. Yeast infections usually are treated with an over-the-counter antifungal cream or suppository, such as miconazole (Monistat 1), clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF, Mycelex, Trivagizole 3), butoconazole (Gynazole-1) or tioconazole (Vagistat-1). Yeast infections might also be treated with a prescription oral antifungal medication, such as fluconazole (Diflucan). The advantages of over-the-counter treatment are convenience, cost and not having to wait to see a health care provider. The disadvantage is the possibility of treating something other than a yeast infection. Using the wrong medicine may delay an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. Trichomoniasis. Your provider may prescribe metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax) tablets. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vaginal atrophy). Estrogen — in the form of vaginal creams, tablets or rings — can treat this condition. This treatment is available by prescription from your health care provider, after other risk factors and possible complications are reviewed. Noninfectious vaginitis. To treat this type of vaginitis, you'll need to pinpoint the source of the irritation and avoid it. Possible sources include new soap, laundry detergent, sanitary napkins or tampons.",

    "information": "Daily probiotic capsules containing Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 or L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 taken orally for 60 days increase vaginal colonization of lactobacilli and reduce recurrence rates of BV and VVC by approximately 15–20%. Probiotics are most effective when combined with standard antimicrobial therapy and should contain at least 10^8–10^9 CFU per strain.",

    "information": "Vaginal douching is associated with increased risk of BV, DIV, AV, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Douching alters the vaginal microbiome, reduces lactobacilli, and facilitates acquisition of STIs. US national surveys show 15–25% of reproductive-age women report douching; rates are highest among African American women. Counseling to discontinue douching is a recommended preventive intervention.",
