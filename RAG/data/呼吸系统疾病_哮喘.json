    "information": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, which often worsen at night or early in the morning. The development of asthma is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors contribute to the predisposition to asthma, with multiple genes involved in regulating immune responses and airway function. Environmental triggers include allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, animal dander), respiratory infections (especially viral infections in childhood), air pollution, tobacco smoke, physical activity, and emotional stress. Diagnosis of asthma involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and pulmonary function tests. Spirometry is a key test to assess airflow limitation, measuring FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio. Bronchial provocation testing may be used to demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with normal baseline spirometry. Bronchodilator responsiveness testing assesses the reversibility of airflow limitation. Management of asthma aims to achieve symptom control, prevent exacerbations, maintain normal lung function, and improve quality of life. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers, pharmacologic therapy, and patient education. Pharmacologic agents are classified as controller medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophylline) which are used regularly to prevent symptoms, and reliever medications (e.g., short-acting beta2-agonists, anticholinergics, systemic corticosteroids) which are used to quickly relieve acute symptoms. Regular monitoring of asthma control, adjustment of treatment plans, and education on self-management (including proper inhaler technique and action plans) are essential components of effective asthma care.",

    "information": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory condition characterized by hallmark symptoms of intermittent dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. A confirmed diagnosis relies on consistent respiratory symptoms and the identification of variable expiratory airflow obstruction documented on spirometry. Clinicians prioritize symptom control and prevention of future exacerbations through tailored treatment, considering symptom frequency, severity, and potential risks in a step-wise approach. Early recognition and intervention of asthma exacerbations are crucial to prevent the progression of asthma to severe, life-threatening stages.\n\nAsthma is a prevalent chronic inflammatory respiratory condition affecting millions of people worldwide and presents substantial challenges in both diagnosis and management. This respiratory condition is characterized by inflammation of the airways, causing intermittent airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The hallmark asthma symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, which can be frequently exacerbated by triggers ranging from allergens to viral infections. The prevalence and severity of asthma are determined by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Despite treatment advancements, disparities persist in asthma care, with variations in access to diagnosis, treatment, and patient education across different demographics.\n\nAsthma manifests with diverse phenotypes, likely influenced by intricate interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Genomewide association studies have linked childhood-onset asthma to markers near the ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3) and gasdermin B (GSDMB) genes on chromosome 17q21, encoding ORM1-like protein 3 and gasdermin-like protein. Other associations include genes such as interleukin-33 (IL33), IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1R1) genes, and a novel susceptibility locus at the IF-inducible protein X (PYHIN1) gene, particularly affecting individuals of African descent. The EVE Consortium also identifies a susceptibility locus for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cell–derived cytokine implicated in asthma-related inflammation initiation. Asthma patients exhibit higher TSLP expression in their airways compared to healthy controls. Additional genetic loci involved in asthma include major histocompatibility complex class II DQ α1 (HLA-DQA1), HLA-DQB1 antisense RNA 1 (HLA-DQB1), Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), IL-6 receptor (IL6R), zona pellucida-binding protein 2 (ZPBP2), and gasdermin A (GSDMA). Genetics may also be pivotal in asthma treatment. The hydroxy-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3-beta- and steroid δ-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1) genotype is associated with glucocorticoid resistance among patients. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1) and SPATA13 antisense RNA 1 (SPATA13-AS1) are associated with BDR in Black children. Differing concordance rates among monozygotic twins suggest that exposure to environmental factors has an essential role in the development of asthma. Specific alleles have different effects depending on the environmental exposures. For example, exposure to secondhand smoke associates variations in the N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) gene with the development of asthma in children. A study involving 983 children with single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3 and GSDMB at chromosome locus 17q21 reveals that the same genotype poses genetic risk while also offering environmental protection.\n\nRisk factors for asthma development encompass exposures throughout a patient's lifespan, including the perinatal period. The most substantial known risk factor is atopy, which is characterized by the genetic tendency to produce specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in response to common environmental allergens. Nearly one-third of children with atopy will develop asthma later in life. Prematurity is the most crucial risk factor influencing asthma incidence during this period. Preterm birth, occurring before 36 weeks, is associated with an elevated risk of asthma throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Researchers posit that impaired lung development in preterm infants, even in those without early respiratory complications, increases the long-term risk of asthma. Exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy causes diminished pulmonary function in newborns and an increased probability of developing childhood asthma. Moreover, smoking during pregnancy correlates with several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature delivery, further elevating the asthma risk. The incidence of childhood asthma increases with a maternal age of 20 or younger and decreases with a maternal age of 30 or older. Maternal diet during pregnancy holds significance, with researchers suggesting that vitamin D deficiency contributes to early-life wheezing and asthma primarily by impacting the immune function of various cell types, notably dendritic and T regulatory cells. Additionally, vitamin D plays a role in fetal lung development. Although some studies present conflicting findings regarding the association between maternal vitamin D levels and childhood asthma, a meta-analysis of 2 large studies indicates that maternal vitamin D intake offers protection against wheezing or asthma in offspring up to the age of 3. The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) reveals that 17% of children born to mothers with diets high in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids developed persistent wheeze or asthma during the first 3 years of life compared to nearly 24% in the group with diets high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Vitamins E and C and zinc may also have protective effects. Administering vitamin C at a dose of 500 mg/d to pregnant mothers appears to offer protection against the harmful effects of tobacco exposure. Offspring of mothers who receive vitamin C supplementation exhibit a wheezing incidence of 28%, while those without vitamin C supplementation have a higher incidence of 47%. Wheezing caused by viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, may predispose infants and young children to develop asthma later in life. In addition, early-life exposure to air pollution, including combustion by-products from gas-fired appliances and indoor fires, obesity, and early puberty, also increases the risk of asthma. The most significant risk factors for adult-onset asthma include tobacco smoke, occupational exposure, and adults with rhinitis or atopy. Studies also suggest a modest increase in asthma incidence among postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore, the following factors can contribute to asthma and airway hyperreactivity: Exposure to environmental allergens such as house dust mites, animal allergens (especially from cats and dogs), cockroach allergens, and fungi; Physical activity or exercise; Conditions such as hyperventilation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and chronic sinusitis; Hypersensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as sulfite sensitivity; Use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers, including ophthalmic preparations; Exposure to irritants such as household sprays and paint fumes; Contact with various high- and low-molecular-weight compounds found in insects, plants, latex, gums, diisocyanates, anhydrides, wood dust, and solder fluxes, which are associated with occupational asthma; Emotional factors or stress. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a condition characterized by a combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and NSAID intolerance. Patients with AERD present with upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms after ingesting aspirin or NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). This condition arises from dysregulated arachidonic acid metabolism and the overproduction of leukotrienes involving the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. AERD affects approximately 7% of adults with asthma. Two types of occupational asthma exist based on their appearance after a latency period: Occupational asthma triggered by workplace sensitizers results from an allergic or immunological process associated with a latency period induced by both low- and high-molecular-weight agents. High-molecular-weight substances, such as flour, contain proteins and polysaccharides of plant or animal origin. Low-molecular-weight substances, like formaldehyde, form a sensitizing neoantigen when combined with a human protein. Occupational asthma caused by irritants involves a nonallergic or nonimmunological process induced by gases, fumes, smoke, and aerosols.\n\nThe worldwide incidence of asthma is estimated to affect 260 million individuals. Recent studies examining asthma prevalence across 17 countries reveal varying rates, ranging from 3.4% to 6% for adults and children in India, Taiwan, Kosovo, Nigeria, and Russia, and higher rates of 17% to 33% for Honduras, Costa Rica, Brazil, and New Zealand. Despite data showing the death rate consistently declining for asthma between 2001 and 2015, asthma continues to account for approximately 420,000 deaths per year. Factors such as under-prescription of inhaled glucocorticoids and limited access to emergency medical care or specialist care all play a role in asthma-related deaths. Asthma prevalence in the United States differs among demographic groups, including age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 25 million Americans are currently affected by asthma. Among individuals younger than 18, boys exhibit a higher prevalence compared to girls, while among adults, women are more commonly affected than men. Additionally, asthma prevalence is notably higher among Black individuals, with a prevalence of 10.1%, compared to White individuals at 8.1%. Hispanic Americans generally have a lower prevalence of 6.4%, except for those from Puerto Rico, where the prevalence rises to 12.8%. Moreover, underrepresented minorities and individuals living below the poverty line experience the highest incidence of asthma, along with heightened rates of asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Similar to worldwide data, the mortality rate of asthma in the United States has also undergone a consistent decline. The current mortality rate is 9.86 per million compared to 15.09 per million in 2001. However, mortality rates remain consistently higher for Black patients compared to their White counterparts. According to the CDC, from 1999 to 2016, asthma death rates among adults aged 55 to 64 were 16.32 per 1 million persons, 9.95 per 1 million for females, 9.39 per 1 million for individuals who were not Hispanic or Latino, and notably higher at 25.60 per 1 million for Black patients.\n\nAsthma is a syndrome characterized by diverse underlying mechanisms and involves intricate interactions among inflammatory and resident airway cells. These mechanisms lead to airway inflammation, intermittent airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The activation of mast cells by cytokines and other mediators plays a pivotal role in the development of clinical asthma. Following initial allergen inhalation, affected patients produce specific IgE antibodies due to an overexpression of the T-helper 2 subset (Th2) of lymphocytes relative to the Th1 type. Cytokines produced by Th2 lymphocytes include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which promote IgE and eosinophilic responses in atopy. Once produced, these specific IgE antibodies bind to receptors on mast cells and basophils. Upon additional allergen inhalation, allergen-specific IgE antibodies on the mast cell surface undergo cross-linking, leading to rapid degranulation and the release of histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and cysteinyl leukotrienes C4 (LTC4), D4 (LTD4), and E4 (LTE4). This triggers contraction of the airway smooth muscle within minutes and may stimulate reflex neural pathways. Subsequently, an influx of inflammatory cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, may lead to delayed bronchoconstriction several hours later. The narrowing of the airway lumen throughout the tracheobronchial tree is caused by the contraction of airway smooth muscle, thickening of the airway wall due to edema, mucus plugging in the airways, and airway remodeling, which collectively contributes to varying levels of airflow obstruction. Mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes, released from inflammatory cells or through reflex neural pathways, trigger the contraction and relaxation of airway smooth muscle. The precise mechanism leading to airway hyperresponsiveness, characterized by an excessive tightening of the airway's smooth muscles in response to various physical, chemical, or environmental triggers, remains unclear. Some researchers propose alterations in breathing patterns where smooth muscles contract excessively or fail to relax adequately during deep breaths as a potential explanation. Airway remodeling, which involves thickening of the basement membrane, deposition of collagen, and shedding of epithelial cells, can lead to irreversible changes in the airways. This process accelerates the decline in lung function, particularly in individuals with severe and early-onset asthma. In addition, remodeling contributes to the heightened bronchial sensitivity observed in asthma. Arachidonic acid metabolism by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) leads to the generation of leukotrienes, which serve as potent bronchoconstrictors. The metabolism of arachidonic acid by the 2 cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms—COX-1 and COX-2—generates prostaglandins and thromboxanes. PGD2 is a potent bronchodilator, while PGE2 suppresses the production of leukotrienes. Patients with AERD have dysregulated arachidonic acid metabolism, causing decreased production of PGE2 and loss of control of leukotriene production. Patients with occupational-induced asthma can undergo an immunologically mediated response similar to those without occupational-induced asthma. Alternatively, others may present with nonimmunological occupational asthma. The possible underlying mechanisms of the nonimmunological form are denudation of the airway epithelium, direct β-2 adrenergic receptor inhibition, or elaboration of substance P by injured sensory nerves.\n\nThe 4 cardinal symptoms associated with asthma are wheezing, cough (often worse at night), shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Individuals may experience 1 or more of these symptoms. Asthma symptoms typically occur intermittently, lasting for hours to days, and resolve upon the removal of triggers or the administration of asthma medications. Nighttime exacerbation of symptoms or onset triggered by exercise, cold air, or allergen exposure suggests asthma. In contrast to exertional dyspnea, which manifests shortly after beginning exertion and resolves within 5 minutes of cessation, exercise-induced asthma symptoms typically emerge around 15 minutes into activity and dissipate within 30 to 60 minutes afterward. Patients may also have a history of other forms of atopy, such as eczema and hay fever. During patient history-taking, healthcare professionals should inquire about particular triggers that exacerbate symptoms. Common household triggers include dust, animals, and infestations of rodents and cockroaches. Some individuals may experience intermittent asthma symptoms related to their work shifts. A strong family history of asthma and allergies, or a personal history of atopic conditions and childhood asthma symptoms, suggests asthma in patients exhibiting suggestive symptoms. During physical examination, widespread, high-pitched wheezes are a characteristic finding associated with asthma. However, wheezing is not specific to asthma and is typically absent between acute exacerbations. Findings suggestive of a severe asthma exacerbation include tachypnea, tachycardia, a prolonged expiratory phase, reduced air movement, difficulty speaking in",

    "information": "哮喘是一种慢性肺病，影响所有年龄段的人。它是由气道周围炎症和肌肉收紧引起的一种疾病，致使呼吸比较困难。症状可能包括咳嗽、喘息、呼吸短促和胸闷。这些症状有的轻微，有的严重，并且会随着时间的推移而时不时发作。虽然哮喘可能是一种严重的健康问题，但可以通过适当治疗来加以控制。有哮喘症状的人应向卫生专业人员咨询。\n\n哮喘往往诊断不足，治疗也不足，特别是在低收入和中等收入国家。未获充分治疗的哮喘患者可能会有睡眠障碍、白天疲劳和注意力无法集中等问题。哮喘患者及其家人可能会有上学和上班迟到的情况，对家庭和更广泛的社区产生经济影响。如果症状严重，哮喘患者可能需要紧急医治，并且可能需要住院治疗和留观。在最严重情况下，哮喘可能导致死亡。\n\n哮喘症状可能因人而异。症状有时会明显恶化。这就是所谓的哮喘发作。症状往往在夜间或运动时更严重。哮喘的常见症状包括：持续咳嗽，尤其是在夜间；呼气时喘息，有时吸气时喘息；呼吸短促或呼吸困难，有时甚至在休息时；胸闷，难以深呼吸。有些人在感冒或天气变化时症状会加重。其他诱发因素可能包括灰尘、烟雾、气雾、草和树花粉、动物皮毛和羽毛、强效肥皂和香水。其他健康问题也可能会引起哮喘症状。出现症状的患者应向卫生保健服务提供者咨询。\n\n有很多因素可能会加剧哮喘风险，但通常很难找到单一的直接病因。如果其他家庭成员（尤其是父母或兄弟姐妹等近亲属）也哮喘问题，本人也有哮喘问题的可能性增大。有湿疹和鼻炎（枯草热）等其他过敏症的人有哮喘问题的可能性增大。可能由于多重生活方式的原因，城市化也是造成哮喘流行率上升的一种因素。早年事件会影响肺部发育，并可能增加哮喘风险。这包括低出生体重、早产、接触烟草烟雾和其他空气污染源，以及病毒性呼吸道感染。接触一系列环境过敏原和刺激物也会增加哮喘风险，例如室内和室外空气污染、室内尘螨、霉菌以及职业接触化学品、烟雾或灰尘等。超重或肥胖的儿童和成人患哮喘的风险增加。\n\n哮喘无法治愈，但有几种治疗方法。最常见的治疗方法是使用吸入剂，将药物直接输送到肺部。吸入剂可以有助于控制疾病，使哮喘患者过上正常、活跃的生活。有两种主要类型的吸入剂：支气管扩张剂（如沙丁胺醇），用于打开气道，缓解症状；以及类固醇（如倍氯米松）可减少气道炎症，改善哮喘症状和降低严重哮喘发作和死亡的风险。哮喘患者可能需要每天使用吸入剂。治疗方法取决于出现症状的频率和可用的吸入剂种类。使用吸入剂可能很难，特别是对于儿童和在紧急情况下。使用间隔装置可以让使用气雾吸入剂变得容易一些。这样有助于药物更容易到达肺部。间隔装置是一种塑料容器，一端有吹嘴或面罩，另一端有一个吸入孔。用500毫升塑料瓶制成的自制间隔装置可以与商业制造的间隔装置一样有效。在许多国家，吸入剂的获取仍是一个问题。2021年，有半数低收入和中低收入国家的公共初级卫生保健机构能够提供支气管扩张剂，三分之一的国家能够提供类固醇吸入剂。提高社区意识以减少某些地方对哮喘的误解和歧视也很重要。\n\n哮喘是一种影响儿童和成人的主要非传染性疾病，是最常见的儿童慢性病。肺部小气道炎症和变窄会导致哮喘症状，例如咳嗽、喘鸣、呼吸短促和胸闷等症状或任何这类综合症状。2019年，约有2.62亿人有哮喘问题，45.5万人死亡。用药可以控制哮喘症状，使哮喘患者过上正常、活跃的生活。避免哮喘诱发因素也有助于减少哮喘症状。大多数哮喘死亡发生在低收入和中低收入国家。这些国家面临诊断和治疗不足的挑战。",

    "information": "Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.\n\nAsthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. Asthma signs and symptoms include: Shortness of breath, Chest tightness or pain, Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children, Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing, Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu. Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome, Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter), The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often. For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry, Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust, Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander).\n\nSevere asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing, No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler, Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity. If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.\n\nIt isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors. Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste, Respiratory infections, such as the common cold, Physical activity, Cold air, Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke, Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), Strong emotions and stress, Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat.\n\nA number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include: Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling, Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes, Being overweight, Being a smoker, Exposure to secondhand smoke, Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution, Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing.\n\nAsthma complications include: Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities, Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups, A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe, Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks, Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma. Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma.\n\nWhile there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. Follow your asthma action plan. With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan. Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life. Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia. Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. Identify and avoid asthma triggers. A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. Monitor your breathing. You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home. Identify and treat attacks early. If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan. Take your medication as prescribed. Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.",

    "information": "哮喘是一种异质性疾病，新版指南强调了肺功能在哮喘诊断中的作用，提出重视不典型哮喘的诊治，并新增哮喘流行病学、哮喘的评估、重症哮喘的规范诊治、特殊类型哮喘及哮喘的某些特殊问题等四方面内容，为哮喘规范化诊治提供了重要的参考。\n\n哮喘是由多种细胞包括嗜酸性粒细胞、肥大细胞、T淋巴细胞、中性粒细胞、平滑肌细胞、气道上皮细胞等及细胞组分参与的气道慢性炎症性疾病。其临床表现为反复发作的喘息、气急、胸闷或咳嗽等症状, 常在夜间及凌晨发作或加重, 多数患者可自行缓解或经治疗后缓解, 同时伴有可变的气流受限和气道高反应性, 随着病程的延长可导致一系列气道结构的改变, 即气道重塑。哮喘是一种异质性疾病, 具有不同的临床病程和治疗反应。临床典型的哮喘患者根据症状和相关检查可迅速诊断, 但对无喘息症状、也无哮鸣音的不典型哮喘患者常常易漏诊或误诊。可变气流受限客观检查对不典型哮喘的诊断更为重要, 可有效减少不典型哮喘的漏诊和误诊。\n\n1979年美国学者Corrao等在《新英格兰医学杂志》发文描述了以咳嗽为唯一症状、有气道高反应、支气管扩张剂治疗有效的哮喘患者, 即咳嗽变异性哮喘。1992年广州呼吸疾病研究所钟南山院士团队研究发现, 无症状的支气管高反应性患者经过随访会发展为有典型症状的哮喘, 即为亚临床或隐匿性哮喘 。2013年, 沈华浩教授团队发现临床上有这样一类患者:没有典型的喘息症状及发作时哮鸣音, 而以胸闷为唯一临床表现, 常怀疑系“心脏疾病”或“心因性疾病”。肺功能检查提示这类患者存在气道高反应性或可逆性气流受限, 气道活检标本证实与哮喘一致的病理学改变, 予支气管扩张剂和吸入糖皮质激素治疗有效, 符合支气管哮喘的诊断, 从而在国际上第一次提出了胸闷变异性哮喘的概念 。\n\nCTVA以中青年多见, 起病隐匿, 胸闷可在活动后诱发, 部分患者夜间发作较为频繁, 没有反复发作的喘息、气促等典型的哮喘表现, 胸闷发作时双肺听诊无哮鸣音, 肺功能检查多数正常, 少数患者可有轻度阻塞性通气功能障碍的表现, 第1秒用力呼气量占用力肺活量的比值小于70%或FEV 1小于正常预计值的80%, 具有气道高反应性、可逆性气流受限以及典型哮喘的病理特征, 相对典型哮喘患者, 诱导痰嗜酸性粒细胞比例增高少见, 但合并焦虑症状多见, 应用一般的祛痰止咳药或抗菌药物治疗无效, 但平喘药物治疗常有明显的效果。目前, CTVA全国多中心大型临床研究已经启动, 由浙江大学医学院附属第二医院和广州国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心牵头, 在全国各地三十多家大型综合医院联合开展, 目的是研究该变异类型哮喘的发病率和病理特征。\n\n老版指南中, 患者只要具备典型哮喘的临床症状和体征, 除外其他疾病所引起的喘息、气急、胸闷和咳嗽, 即可诊断为哮喘 , 肺功能检查并非必须。2012年加拿大出台的哮喘管理指南要求, 诊断6岁以上哮喘患者需同时符合临床病史和肺功能客观检查 。2014年英国出台的指南推荐肺功能作为评估气流受限严重程度的重要检查, 但并未强调肺功能是诊断哮喘必备检查 。2014年GINA推荐通过测定气流受限和可逆性程度来诊断哮喘 。2014年《华盛顿内科治疗学手册》建议根据临床症状和可逆性气流受限诊断哮喘 。2015年英国国家卫生与临床优化研究所指南要求根据症状并结合客观检查来诊断哮喘 。2015年GINA报告中, 哮喘诊断标准包括可逆性气流受限, 这也需要肺功能检查提供客观数据 。综合上述, 绝大多数国外的指南都非常重视客观诊断指标在哮喘诊断中的作用。结合我国现状, 目前国内肺功能检查的普及率大大提高, 许多县级医院亦能开展。为避免哮喘过度诊断和误诊, 推进肺功能检查作为哮喘诊断的必要条件是可行的。因此, 新版指南要求哮喘诊断时肺功能检查与临床症状缺一不可:符合典型哮喘的临床症状和体征, 同时具备气流受限客观检查中的任一条, 并除外其他疾病所引起的喘息、气急、胸闷及咳嗽。并且, 新版指南修改了支气管舒张试验阳性的标准和呼气流量峰值变异率的计算方式, 以保持与国际其他指南一致。\n\n老版指南中, PEF日内变异率为20%以上对哮喘有诊断意义 。这项标准的依据是基于1980年Hetzel等的研究。他们连续测定145位非哮喘患者的PEF值, 其PEF变异率为18.7%。既往GINA指南也一直采用这一标准。然而在临床上, 通常患者每日PEF仅测两次, 这就导致哮喘诊断的概率下降。Kunzli等 对哮喘患者进行每日两次PEF值测定, 以PEF日变异率大于20%作为阳性诊断, 结果提示哮喘诊断的敏感性为36%, 阳性预测值仅16.4%。另有研究显示, 一日二次测定PEF值, PEF变异率的95%可信区间在健康成人中为9% 。因此, 从2006年开始, GINA除了保留原有的PEF变异率大于20%作为哮喘的诊断标准之外, 又特别注明, 如若是一日二次测量法, 则PEF变异率超过10%即诊断为哮喘 。然而国内仍有部分临床医师仅以PEF变异率超过20%作为评估哮喘的标准, 导致不少患者漏诊。因此, 为遵循国内使用习惯, 新版指南对PEF变异率在哮喘中的诊断标准做出修改, 规定如下: PEF平均每日昼夜变异率超过10%, 或PEF周变异率超过20%。\n\n新版指南新增哮喘评估章节, 评估患者是否有合并症, 评估哮喘的触发因素, 评估患者的药物使用情况, 评估患者的临床控制水平。新版指南针对哮喘控制水平分级更为明确和具有可操作性:根据过去4周患者日间哮喘症状、夜间因哮喘憋醒、使用缓解药次数和哮喘引起的活动受限四个指标, 将患者分为哮喘症状良好控制、部分控制和未控制。评估结果为未控制、接触变应原、有上述合并症、用药不规范、依从性差以及过去一年曾有哮喘急性发作急诊或住院史等都是未来哮喘急性发作的危险因素。\n\n评估的主要方法包括症状, 肺功能, 哮喘控制测试问卷, 呼出气一氧化氮, 痰嗜酸性粒细胞计数和外周血嗜酸性粒细胞计数。其中, FEV 1和PEF是客观判断哮喘病情最常用的评估指标; ACT问卷不要求测试患者的肺功能, 简便、易操作, 适合在缺乏肺功能设备的基层医院推广应用; FeNO测定可以作为评估气道炎症和哮喘控制水平的指标, 也可用于判断吸入激素治疗的反应。\n\n哮喘慢性持续期的治疗原则基于患者病情严重程度和控制水平, 选择相应的治疗方案, 定期随访、监测, 并根据患者控制水平及时调整治疗以达到并维持哮喘控制的目的。\n\n一旦确立了哮喘的诊断, 尽早开始规律的控制治疗对于取得最佳的疗效至关重要。新版指南推荐的长期阶梯式治疗方案分为五级, 对于成人哮喘患者的初始治疗, 应根据患者具体情况选择合适的级别, 或在两相邻级别之间选择高的级别, 以保证初始治疗的成功率。新版指南详细列举了患者当前症状及相应推荐的初始治疗方案。比如, 大多数天数有哮喘症状, 有夜醒每周一次或以上, 存在任何危险因素, 推荐中剂量吸入性糖皮质激素或低剂量ICS/长效β 2激动剂作为控制治疗。通常起始治疗后每2~4周需复诊, 以后每1~3月随访一次, 如急性发作则1周内需要复诊。\n\n第1级推荐治疗方案:按需吸入短效β 2受体激动剂。适用于偶有短暂的白天症状, 没有夜间症状, 肺功能正常的患者。\n\n第2级推荐治疗方案:低剂量ICS加按需使用缓解药物。白三烯受体拮抗剂可用于不能够或不愿意接受ICS治疗、不能耐受ICS不良反应, 或合并过敏性鼻炎、咳嗽变异性哮喘、运动性哮喘、阿司匹林以及药物诱发性哮喘的初始治疗, 但其作用比ICS弱。\n\n第3级推荐治疗方案:低剂量ICS/LABA复合制剂作为维持治疗, 加SABA作为缓解治疗; 含有福莫特罗的ICS/LABA复合制剂可以采用维持加缓解治疗。\n\n第4级推荐治疗方案:低剂量ICS/福莫特罗维持加缓解治疗, 或中等剂量ICS/LABA复合制剂加按需使用SABA。值得注意的是, 中国哮喘患者接受GINA推荐ICS高限剂量的一半, 也能获得与高限剂量相似的效果。\n\n第5级推荐治疗方案:转诊给哮喘专科医师, 考虑叠加治疗。可采用的选择包括:加用抗胆碱能药物 、抗IgE治疗 、生物标志物指导的治疗 、支气管热成形术 、叠加低剂量口服糖皮质激素。\n\n当目前级别的治疗方案不能控制哮喘, 应给予升级治疗, 选择更高级别的治疗方案直至达到哮喘控制为止。升级治疗前需排除和纠正影响哮喘控制的因素, 如药物吸入方法不正确、依从性差、持续暴露于触发因素、存在合并症所致呼吸道症状及影响生活质量、哮喘诊断错误等。哮喘的升级治疗分为三种方式:①持久升级治疗:对于在当前治疗级别不能控制的哮喘患者, 推荐选择高一级别的治疗方案; ②短程加强治疗:如发生病毒性上",
