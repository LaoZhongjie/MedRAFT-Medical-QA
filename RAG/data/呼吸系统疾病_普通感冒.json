        "information": "Taking vitamin C every day to try to prevent colds won't protect most people from colds. It only slightly shortens the amount of time that they're ill. Starting to take vitamin C once you already have cold symptoms won't have any effect on your cold. You need a certain amount of vitamin C to stay healthy and well, and most people get enough in their daily diet. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can be found in fruits and vegetables, and citrus fruits and berries have especially high levels of vitamin C. Medical conditions that are caused by vitamin C deficiency, such as scurvy, are practically non-existent in countries like Germany. Despite this, many people take vitamin C supplements every day in order to prevent a number of different illnesses, particularly colds. Some of these products have more than one gram of vitamin C, which is more than ten times the recommended daily amount, which is about 100 milligrams (mg). Because the body can't store vitamin C, the excess vitamins are usually flushed out of the body in urine within a few hours, so they end up in the toilet. Studies on vitamin C Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration – an international network of researchers – looked into the question of whether taking large doses of vitamin C can protect against colds or relieve the symptoms. To find out, they analyzed studies comparing vitamin C with a product that didn't contain any active ingredients (a placebo). 29 studies, involving more than 11,000 children and adults, tested whether the regular use of supplements containing at least 200 mg of vitamin C prevented colds. Most of the studies tested a dose of 1,000 or more mg of vitamin C per day. Some of the participants took the vitamin C over a period of several years. Research results The studies showed that it wasn't possible to prevent colds by taking vitamin C every day over a longer period of time. But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. Other studies show that taking vitamin C only after becoming ill didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women. It didn’t relieve their symptoms, either. Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in extremely cold temperatures. Examples include marathon runners or soldiers doing winter exercises in a mountainous region. The study participants started taking vitamin C two to three weeks before the activities, with the aim of preventing colds. It was found that doing so reduced their risk of developing a cold by about half. Taking very high doses of vitamin C regularly may cause diarrhea, but the study participants who took vitamin C didn’t report having more side effects than those who used a placebo.",

Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider. However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose. Cough. Sore throat. Headache. Nasal congestion. Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis, causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest.

        "information": "Upper respiratory tract infections result in an estimated increase of 12.5% in patient visits per month during cold and flu season. In the United States, direct medical costs related to the common cold (physician visits, secondary infections and medications) were an estimated $17 billion a year in 1997. Indirect costs owing to missed work because of illness or caring for an ill child were an estimated $25 billion a year. We review the evidence underpinning preventive and treatment interventions for the common cold. We do not explore the proposed biologic mechanisms for the different products, because most are not substantiated and generally represent more supposition than science. The quality of the evidence was frequently poor, with a moderate to high risk of bias. Although preventive interventions have somewhat discrete outcomes (presence of an upper respiratory tract infection), interpretation of the evidence for treatment of the common cold is challenged by the complexity of outcome reporting. The evidence used in this review is described in Box 1. In July and August 2012, a literature search was performed by one of us of PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ACP Journal Club and Evidence-Based Medicine. Search terms included 'common cold' and 'upper respiratory tract infection.' In PubMed, the search was restricted to randomized controlled trials, reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Individual treatments were also searched (e.g., 'vitamin C'). A similar search was performed in early 2012 by the coauthor for a related project. We conducted a manual search of the bibliographies of included articles. Further details of the literature search are available from the authors upon request. We selected the highest level of evidence available for each intervention, focusing on systematic reviews (with or without a meta-analysis) and RCTs. We rated the quality of evidence for each intervention as high, moderate or low risk of bias. For systematic reviews, we considered the authors’ assessment of methodologic quality (e.g., blinding) of included trials but also examined the quality of the systematic review itself (e.g., thoroughness of the literature search). For RCTs, we considered traditional validity criteria (e.g., allocation concealment) as well other limitations (e.g., funding or restricted populations). Lastly, we considered the overall volume (size and number of RCTs) and the consistency of the evidence. We used lower levels of evidence for general information such as epidemiology. How can the common cold be distinguished from other conditions? The symptoms and signs of the common cold overlap with those of other conditions. Allergic rhinitis presents similarly, but it may have a seasonal component or clear allergic aggravation and is unlikely to have an accompanying sore throat. When sore throat is the primary complaint, streptococcal pharyngitis should be considered. Sinusitis (acute or subacute) is a clinical diagnosis without reliable clinical scoring criteria to help differentiate it from the common cold. Groups reviewing the evidence for the antibiotic treatment of sinusitis recommend that symptoms be present for 7–10 days and not show signs of improvement before antibiotics are considered. More details regarding primary conditions whose signs and symptoms overlap with those of the common cold are available in guidelines and review articles on allergic rhinitis, sore throat, sinusitis, otitis media and influenza. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has released a primary care guide for prescribing antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections. Physical intervention Various techniques (e.g., handwashing, use of alcohol-based hand disinfectant, gloves, masks) Systematic review of 67 studies (various types) High (studies had unclear risk of bias for most quality indicators) General reduced risk with handwashing, hand disinfectant, gloves and masks N95 masks offered no advantage over normal surgical masks, were uncomfortable and irritated the skin Likely beneficial",

        "information": "What Is a Cold? Colds are typically minor infections of the nose and throat (upper respiratory tract) caused by more than 200 different respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of colds in the U.S. Parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus and common human coronaviruses also cause colds. A cold may last for about one week, but some colds last longer, especially in children, the elderly and those in poor health. Adults get an average of two to three colds per year, mostly between September and May. Children suffer from more colds per year than adults. Colds are highly contagious. They most often spread through droplets of fluid from an infected person sneezing or coughing. These droplets can enter your body through breathing them in or touching a contaminated surface then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Common Cold Symptoms Between one and three days after a cold virus enters the body, symptoms start developing, such as: Runny nose or congestion Sneezing Sore throat Headache Cough Respiratory viruses can cause complications such as middle ear infections, sinus infections, asthma attacks, bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways), pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and worsening of chronic medical conditions like COPD. Is it a Cold or More Serious Respiratory Virus? Symptoms of the flu, COVID-19 and RSV are similar to the common cold, but they last longer, tend to be worse, and can have serious outcomes. The flu, COVID-19, and RSV can cause hospitalization and even death especially in individuals at increased risk for severe illness. These respiratory viruses do not cause colds and if you suspect you have the flu or COVID-19, you should get tested, especially if you are at increased risk for severe disease. What Can Be Done If You Catch a Cold? The common cold does not have a treatment but should get better on its own. Over-the-counter medications can provide temporary relief of symptoms and help you feel better. They do not cure your illness. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist about over-the-counter medication and mention any other prescription you are taking or medical condition you have.",

        "information": "Overview The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat. Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. Germs called viruses cause a common cold. Often, adults may have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have colds more often. Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider. Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections. Symptoms Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include: Runny or stuffy nose. Sore or scratchy throat. Cough. Sneezing. Generally feeling unwell. Slight body aches or a mild headache. Low-grade fever. The mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green. This change is normal. Most often, it doesn't mean that you have a bacterial illness. When to see a doctor For adults. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. But see your health care provider if you have: Symptoms that get worse or do not get better. Fever greater than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius) that lasts more than three days. Fever returning after a fever-free period. Shortness of breath. Wheezing. Intense sore throat, headache or sinus pain. For children. Most children with a common cold don't need to see a health care provider. Get medical care right away if your child has any of the following: Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in newborns up to 12 weeks. Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age. More-intense symptoms, such as headache, throat pain or cough. Trouble with breathing or wheezing. Ear pain. Fussiness or drowsiness that isn't typical. No interest in eating. Causes Many viruses can cause a common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause. A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by: Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. Hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold. Sharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones. Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus. Risk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold: Age. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings. Weakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk. Time of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter. Smoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.",

Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Gargling with warm salt water. Using saline nose drops or sprays. Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines. But you need to be careful with certain medicines: Children and teens should not take aspirin. Some cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines. Some cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers. If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever. Read the labels on the medicines and follow the instructions carefully. If you have questions, ask your provider or a pharmacist. Antibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds. Most people who have a cold will feel better after a week or two. However, some people who get a cold may develop other illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Can the common cold be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by: Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch. Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands. Staying home when sick.",
