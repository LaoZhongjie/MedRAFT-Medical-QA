      "Although more than 100 viruses can cause a common cold, the rhinovirus is most often the culprit. There are more than 160 rhinovirus types, and they are the most common cause of the common cold. Cold viruses are highly contagious and easily spread from person to person. Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include: Runny or stuffy nose. Sore or scratchy throat. Cough. Sneezing. Generally feeling unwell. Slight body aches or a mild headache. Low-grade fever. The discharge from your nose may start as watery and then become thick and yellow or green as a common cold runs its course. This doesn't usually mean you have a bacterial infection. Many viruses can cause a common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause. A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by: Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. Hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold. Sharing objects, such as towels, toys, or phones, that have the virus on them. Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus. Some things that can increase the risk of getting a cold include: Age. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings. Weak immune system. Having a long-term (chronic) illness or a weak immune system increases the risk. Time of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter, but you can get a cold any time. Smoking. You're more likely to catch a cold and have worse colds if you smoke or are around secondhand smoke. Exposure. Being in crowded places, like schools or airplanes, makes you more likely to be around someone who has a cold. These conditions can occur along with your cold: Middle ear infection. This is also called acute otitis media. It happens when bacteria or viruses get in the space behind the eardrum. Ear pain and green or yellow discharge from the nose are common symptoms. Asthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make asthma symptoms worse. Sinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to sinusitis. This is when the sinuses get inflamed or infected. The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bones of the face and head. Other illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with weak immune systems or lung conditions may have a greater risk of these complications.\n"
